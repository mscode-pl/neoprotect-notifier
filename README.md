## 📢 Available Integrations

### Console

Simple console notifications with colored output.

```json
"console": {
"logPrefix": "NEOPROTECT",
"formatJson": false,
"colorEnabled": true
}
```

### Discord (Webhook)

Send notifications to Discord channels.

```json
"discord": {
"webhookUrl": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR/DISCORD/WEBHOOK",
"username": "NeoProtect Monitor",
"avatarUrl": "https://example.com/avatar.png"
}
```

### Discord Bot

Send notifications to Discord channels, edits embeds for updates and ends.
Some commands are available for the bot, like `!attack <id>` to get more information about an attack.

```json
"discord_bot": {
"token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
"clientId": "YOUR_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID",
"guildId": "YOUR_DISCORD_GUILD_ID",
"channelId": "YOUR_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID",
"commandsEnabled": true,
"allowedRoles": ["ROLE_ID_1", "ROLE_ID_2", "ROLE_ID_3"]
}
```

**Configuration Options:**
- `token` (required): Discord bot token
- `clientId` (optional): Discord application client ID (required for slash commands)
- `guildId` (optional): Discord server ID for guild-specific commands
- `channelId` (required): Discord channel ID for notifications
- `commandsEnabled` (optional): Enable/disable slash commands (default: `true`)
- `allowedRoles` (optional): Array of role IDs allowed to use bot commands. If not set, all users can use commands

**Available Commands:**
- `/attack [id]` - Get information about a specific attack or current active attack
- `/stats [ip]` - Get detailed statistics about DDoS attacks for specific IP or all IPs
- `/history [limit]` - Get attack history (default limit: 5, max: 20)

**Note:** Commands can be disabled by setting `commandsEnabled` to `false`. This is useful if you only want to use the bot for notifications without interactive commands.

### Webhook

"webhook": {
"url": "https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/notify",
"headers": {
"Authorization": "Bearer your-token-here",

## 🧩 Creating Custom Integrations

You can extend the system with custom integrations:

1. **Built-in Integration**:
   - Create a new file in the `integrations` package
   - Implement the `Integration` interface
   - Register it in the `integrations/manager.go` file

2. **Plugin Integration**: (Coming Soon)
   - Create a Go file with an exported `Integration` variable
   - Build it as a plugin: `go build -buildmode=plugin -o ./integrations/myplugin.so myplugin.go`
   - Add the plugin name to `enabledIntegrations` in config

## 🐳 Docker Support (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t neoprotect-notifier .

# Run with Docker
docker run -v $(pwd)/config.json:/app/config.json neoprotect-notifier
```

Or use docker-compose:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
   neoprotect-notifier:
      build: .
      restart: unless-stopped
      volumes:
         - ./config.json:/app/config.json
```
